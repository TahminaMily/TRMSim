TRMSim-WSN (Trust and Reputation Models Simulator for Wireless Sensor Networks) is a Java-based simulator aimed to test Trust and Reputation models for WSNs.
It provides one Trust and Reputation model called BTRM-WSN and new ones can be easily added.

It allows researchers to test and compare their trust and reputation models against a wide range of WSNs. They can decide whether they want static or dynamic networks, the percentage of fraudulent nodes, the percentage of nodes acting as clients or servers, etc.

It has been designed to easily adapt and integrate a new model within the simulator. Only a few classes have to be implementend in order to carry out this task.

TRMSim-WSN has been developed under jdk 1.6. and in order to be able to launch the simulator, the appropriate Java Virtual Machine must be installed on this computer.
